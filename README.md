# DevSecOps-2
That repository is for us three members of the group to share our work and what we have done as of now and regularly.

There was three different branches created sub the main one.
These branches are for each member of the group so that we post about our work in a well developped structure.
Alexandre push all his work in his branche.
Axel push all his work in his branche.
Théo push all his work in his branche.

Is pushed the python, the API's, the Dockers and Github Actions.

The push are being made by lines of code using the cmd not directly on Github.

A new sub branch to the main one will be created to push our final API cause the other branches are only for our own technical developpment.
